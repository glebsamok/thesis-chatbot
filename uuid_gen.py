UUID Generation Utility

This module provides a simple utility for generating unique identifiers (UUIDs).
UUIDs are commonly used in applications to create unique identifiers for users,
sessions, or other entities that need to be uniquely identified.

UUIDs are 128-bit identifiers that are practically guaranteed to be unique
across space and time, making them ideal for distributed systems and
applications requiring unique identification.
